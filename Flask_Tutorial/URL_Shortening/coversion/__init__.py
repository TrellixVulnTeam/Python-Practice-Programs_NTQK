""" This package contains two modules that helps to convert an id to short url having base 62 and vice-versa."""

""" This package is created for the URL shortening api."""

""" URL Shortening Algorithm:
        A long URL is inserted into database and corresponding to an inserted URL an unique id is generated.
        This id is converted into base 62 format.
        What is base 62?
        [a-z] = 26
        [A-Z] = 26
        [0-9] = 10
        While redirected to this long URL id is required so we need short URL to id conversion.
