Request is raised by the browser i. google chrome, safari etc...
There is a computer somewhere on internet receiving the request

That computer has something like flask application.
i.e Flask application receives a request from browser and decide what to do with it and then return response.

Server i.e Flask application must be able to understand that what kind of request is coming.

flask is package and Flask is class.

What is web-server?
It is a piece of Hardware(e.g computer) and Software designed to accept incoming we request.
For example, Google has many web servers.
This course is all about creating web server i.e a Flask App.

What do we send?
When you go to http://www.google.com, you send the following:
GET / HTTP/1.1      >> GET request which is verb, / is a path, HTTP/1.1 protocol
Host: www.google.com
Server may give :
1. error: if /(path) is not found.
2. error: if HTTP is not supported (SMTP, FTP)
3. error: if server is unavailable
4. may give html code back
5. may give you some text back

HTTP Principles
#################
Going to a site does a GET request.

REST API?
Is a way of thinking about how a web server responds to your request.
It doesn't respond with just data
It responds with resources

Resources?
Let's say our server is designed to accept following request.
e.g GET /item/chair
    POST /item/chair/   with extra data
    PUT /item/chair     with extra data
    DELETE /item/chair

    GET /items      Retrieving multiple items

 REST API feature Stateless
 One request can't depend on any other request.

 For e.g
 POST /item/chair   creates an item
 Server doesn't know the item exist after even creating a item
################
JSON: is used to transfer data from one application to another.
